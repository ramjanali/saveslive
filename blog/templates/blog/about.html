					<h2>FAMILY SUPPORT AND RELATED COUNSELLING SERVICES</h2>
					<p>
						<span>In the past, much of the response by The Salvation Army to families was short term, such as help with food and energy bills. In recent years, it has become clear that many people who seek the assistance of The Salvation Army are in need of personal support. Often this is due to the long term impact of issues such as unemployment. Clearly modern life places pressures on personal relationships within the family which is causing more people to seek assistance</span>

					<h2>POVERTY AND EDUCATION: FINDING THE WAY FORWARD</h2>
					<p>
						<span>PREFACE
As citizens, we should concern ourselves with the question of whether the current levels of poverty 
and inequality really matter. The answer is they matter a great deal. As noted in this report, poverty is 
a significant and growing problem for America â€” one that costs our economy hundreds of billions of 
dollars each year, and leaves poor families and individuals with a greatly reduced chance of achieving 
the American Dream. Children raised in poverty today will grow up in circumstances that, the data tell 
us, will give them a small, if not negligible, chance of following a path that will lead them to a markedly 
better place than where they began.
This report makes an important contribution to those who are interested in developing a broader and 
deeper understanding of the connections among poverty, education and outcomes. Information is 
provided that deals with issues such as home factors, food security, availability of health insurance and 
child care, and comparisons are made between poor and non-poor children. On the resource side, 
the authors provide analyses of programs and funding mechanisms intended to disrupt the effects of 
poverty on educational outcomes. The report also provides evidence of the increased levels of social 
and residential stratification in our schools and society, and considers not only how poverty is officially 
measured but several alternative measures that help to broaden our perspective. 
In providing this information, this report gives us a more nuanced picture of poverty in America and 
the consequences it is having on our country. But the report does more than just provide a picture of 
poverty and how it is measured: it also presents strategies that may make a difference and are within the 
purview of education policymakers.
